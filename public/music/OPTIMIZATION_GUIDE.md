# Music File Optimization Guide

## Current Issue
The `ambient-focus.mp3` file is **4.3 MB**, causing 30+ second loading delays.

## Solutions

### 1. Immediate Fix - Compress Current File
To reduce the file size while maintaining quality:

**Using online tools:**
- Go to https://www.media.io/audio-compressor.html
- Upload your `ambient-focus.mp3`
- Set quality to 128 kbps (good balance of quality/size)
- Target size: < 1MB

**Using FFmpeg (if installed):**
```bash
ffmpeg -i ambient-focus.mp3 -b:a 64k -ar 22050 ambient-focus-optimized.mp3
```

### 2. Alternative - Use Multiple Quality Versions
Create different versions for different scenarios:

**Low quality for background (32-64 kbps):**
- Perfect for ambient background music
- Target size: 200-500 KB

**Medium quality for focused listening (128 kbps):**
- Good quality for when user actively listens
- Target size: 800KB - 1.2MB

### 3. Recommended Settings for Background Music
- **Bitrate:** 64 kbps (sufficient for ambient music)
- **Sample Rate:** 22050 Hz (half of CD quality, fine for background)
- **Channels:** Mono (if stereo isn't essential)
- **Target Duration:** 1-2 minutes with seamless loop

### 4. File Naming Convention
- `ambient-focus-low.mp3` (64 kbps, ~300KB)
- `ambient-focus-med.mp3` (128 kbps, ~800KB)
- `ambient-focus-high.mp3` (320 kbps, current quality)

### 5. Implementation Strategy
The music player can start with the low-quality version immediately, then optionally upgrade to higher quality once fully loaded.

## Expected Results
- **Current:** 4.3MB → 30+ seconds loading
- **Optimized:** 300KB → 2-5 seconds loading
- **User Experience:** Immediate music start
